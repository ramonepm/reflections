When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can think of two main reasons. One, I want to have a back up of my work. Second, 
    by having a remote repository I can work on it from many devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you pull changes manually your are able to see the changes made to the repository in the command line, which gives you more control over your work, especially when the code is a collaboration.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Allow you to copy the repositories of other Github users directly to your account.
    Clones: Allows you to copy either your own repositories or those of 
    other users to your local repository.
    Branch: Adds a new commit path to your local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can make continuos merges to the document to keep them more 
    traceable, which will make it much easier to deal with conflicts
    when they arrise.
