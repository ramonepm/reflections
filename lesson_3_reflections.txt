When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can think of two main reasons. One, I want to have a back up of my work. Second, 
    by having a remote repository I can work on it from many devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you pull changes manually your are able to see the changes made to the repository
    in the command line, which gives you more control over your work, especially when the 
    code is a collaboration.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Allow you to copy the repositories of other Github users directly to your account.
    Clones: Allows you to copy either your own repositories or those of 
    other users to your local repository.
    Branch: Adds a new commit path to your local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can make continuos merges to the document to keep them more 
    traceable, which will make it much easier to deal with conflicts
    when they arrise.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    If I needed to collaborate on a coding project I would probably use 
    google drive or dropbox and keep a google docs file with the text 
    of the code so we coulds see what changes had been made. This method 
    would be tedious and it could be a hot spot for bugs. However, it could 
    be a good way to collaborate with beginners or people who are not 
    familiar with git and github. Using google docs would be much easier, 
    at least at first, but also much less efficient.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
