When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I can think of two main reasons. One, I want to have a back up of my work. Second, 
    by having a remote repository I can work on it from many devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When you pull changes manually your are able to see the changes made to the repository
    in the command line, which gives you more control over your work, especially when the 
    code is a collaboration.
